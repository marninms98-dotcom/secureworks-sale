| Mid Dusty Blue | `#4C6A7C` | Secondary text, borders |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds |

## File Structure

```
secureworks-sale/
├── sale.html              ← The entire dashboard
├── shared/

│   └── brand.js           ← Copied from secureworks-site
├── CLAUDE.md              ← This file
```

Everything is in `sale.html`. Do NOT split into multiple files.

## Architecture

### Auth
- Email/password login via cloud.js → Supabase auth
- Admin detection: email contains 'marnin' OR role === 'admin'
- Admin sees all data + salesperson dropdown filter
- Salespeople see only their own data (filtered by `created_by` = user.id)

### Data Sources
- **reporting-api** edge function: `sales_summary`, `sales_pipeline`, `sales_performance`, `sales_leads` actions
- **ops-api** edge function: `add_event` (log activity), `list_users` (admin dropdown)
- Supabase project: `kevgrhcjxspbxgovpmfl`

### Tabs
1. **Today** — Stat cards, action items (follow-ups, expiring quotes), activity feed
2. **Pipeline** — Kanban board (Draft → Quoted → Accepted → Lost)
3. **Performance** — KPIs, weekly trend chart, funnel, suburb breakdown, leaderboard
4. **Leads** — Sortable/filterable table with lead source attribution

### Key Design Decisions
- Salesperson tracking uses `jobs.created_by` (no migration needed)
- Lead source data from `contact_matches` table (LEFT JOIN)
- Desktop: header nav buttons | Mobile: fixed bottom nav
- Chart.js for all charts

---

## Shared File Sync

`cloud.js` and `brand.js` are copies from canonical sources:
- `cloud.js` canonical: `~/Projects/patio-tool/tools/shared/cloud.js`
- `brand.js` canonical: `~/Projects/secureworks-site/dashboard/shared/brand.js`

These will drift. Known debt across all repos.

## Git Workflow

```bash
git pull origin main
# Make changes

```

Deployed via GitHub Pages — pushes go live immediately.
